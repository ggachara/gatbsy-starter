Among the details to capture when receipting are Name of tenant, Building and Unit number, Banking date, Account and Channel of payment, Cheque number if paid via it and finally the correct amount.

A soft preview of the accompanying receipt to payment is then presented with all payment details captured for preview before printing or sending to tenant via email as shown below;

In addition to Tenant Receipting, there is also Non-Tenant Receipting where payment from other persons other than Tenants is captured into the system for financial recording and tracking of expenses.

An accompanying receipt is also presented to them after capture of necessary payment details.
