At the end of the month, the closing transaction procedure generates the final statement of the different accounts and locks out additional transactions from being backdated to dates within the closed transactions periods.

The closing of transactions allows for balancing of the temporary accounts across the different properties.

The closed months list lists all the previously closed months per the building and the total amounts of rent received for that property in that month.

Clicking on the Perform End of Month Procedure button opens the end of month procedure tab where you select the building and perform the procedure.
