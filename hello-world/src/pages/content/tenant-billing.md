# `TENANT BILLING`

One of the main stages in the tenant lifecycle is tenant billing, this involves the identification and generation of due charges to the tenants as per their resource consumption.

In addition to rent, other invoice types you can generate and bill include: water bills, security, garbage, and service charge.

Through this menu you can:

1. Generate water bills for the tenants as per their water unit consumption for a particular billing period.
2. Generate, Invoice, and print all the bills due to tenants via the Invoice List tab.
3. Raise credit notes to their bills amounts via the Credit Notes.

## `Generate Water Bills`

This tab allows for input of water unit per building/property and outputs the correct amount due from the set building unit rate.

On clicking the New Readings button, the entry tab is brought up.

The capture readings tab, upon selection of building and confirmation of bill date, generates an entry sheet in excel format(1) where the user inputs the new unit readings and uploads them back into the system using the Upload Readings button(2) then finally moves them to the invoicing using the Migrate Readings to Bills(3) button.

A record of all the water unit readings captured is stored in the system as per the building and date of capture and billing and can be retrieved at any moment by a user.

## `Invoice List`

The invoice list tab is the bills generation point for all charges due to the tenant.

On the Invoices List tab above controls labelled 1-10 allow:

1. Generation of multiple and varying invoices as per their property and dates.
2. Generation of invoices due to a single tenant.
3. Generation of bulk invoices of the same building and type.
4. Posting of invoices after generation.
5. Printing of all the invoices that are due to a particular building.
6. Selection of building that you would like results of filter to be from.
7. Selection of the status of the invoices to be within results.
8. Selection of the specific unit results from filter should be from.
9. The filter button that sorts data available by parameters set by unit.
10. The number of pages the results of filter occupy.
11. The search function window for filtering the results further by specific keywords.

Authorized users can generate the bills either one at a time or in bulk, at any period during the billable month period and of any type all in-line with the company policy.
The invoices generated are dependent on the presets in the tenant details set during tenant registration and have to be posted after generation.

The following are open pop ups of all the above operations,
