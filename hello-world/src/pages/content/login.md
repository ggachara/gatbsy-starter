# `LOGIN`

Accessing the system is through your preferred web browser *for our guide we will use firefox*.

> The web address to enter into the browser is www.reams.co.ke/companyname
> 
Your introduction to the system is through the Login Screen prompting you to enter your credentials, email and password which will be provided to you by the system administrator.

In the event that a user with a **`REAMSPRO`** account has forgotten their log in credentials there is a forgot password button which when clicked presents the forgot password form below where you are required to input your email address to receive a password reset link in your email inbox

//Forgot password iamge here.

After correctly setting up the password, access will be granted to the user with the new password as their now updated credentials.
A user can repeat the same process every time he/she forgets their password and has a working email account.
